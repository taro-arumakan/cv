Over the time, I have seen him take up ridiculous amount of responsibility and come out on top every single time. But the real treat about Taro is none of these, but the fact that he does all of this while being Zen, oblivious to all the chaos around him. He quite simply has nerves of steel. To Taro is to Zen, to Zen is to Taro! Above all, he is a great mentor and friend who you can reply on anytime, quite literally.",
